* Background

The datasets used for this project were based on the theme of online purchasing in the European Union. This has risen dramatically over the past couple of decades and will have a number of important consequences for society (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/E-commerce_statistics_for_individuals
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20200420-2
http://www.anec.eu/attachments/ANEC-RT-2015-SERV-005.pdf).

General questions include which countries buy online the most, and is this concentrated into wealthier countries? What influences consumer behaviour when buying online and what are their strategies for deciding what to buy?

A number of questions are raised such as do national or foreign sellers benefit more from this shift? Are there problems related to buying online?cite:CitekeyBook

** Datasets
Three dataset were extracted from the Eurostat database using the R Eurostat package  (http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/). This package provides a means to easily query the Eurostat database.

Compiled, the datasets had a total of 4615144 rows and 7 columns (fig 1). Most of this data was ultimately not used, being combinations of locations, years and demographics that were not needed (fig 2). Though imputation was considered to deal with missing values, this was ultimately not necessary to generate the visualisations for this project.
These datasets were appended by a dictionary, also downloaded with the Eurostat package to replace the database codes with human-readable labels. Map coordinate data was imported automatically using the R maps package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/.

** Common design choices
There were some design choices that were shared among the visualisations. The fonts used for this project was the Helvetica and Helvetica Neue families. Since the subject matter was technological in nature, a more slightly more futuristic styling was desired, the use of sans-serif fonts was used exclusively. To make the tone was more informative rather the fun, display fonts were also omitted.
The base colour chosen was "#1E448A", the blue used in the EU commissions flag. Gradient colour scales were extended from this, generated using an online tool https://hihayk.github.io/scale/. This however was abandoned for categorical schemes, as no complementary colour combination could be found that was sufficiently colour blind safe. Instead, categorical colour-schemes were generated using an online tool https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/
Categorical colour schemes were selected to be colour-blind safe and

** Data visualisation
Intro section
*** The rise in purchasing over time
Here, we wish to communicate how the rates of purchasing online have changed over time. With the data available, we can show this for different purchasing rates.
Showing the composition of online purchasing over time and the different purchasing frequencies out there, will inform how significant this subject matter is. It can give an idea of how important purchasing online is becoming.

A number of design choices were made. The number of dimensions was low, so they were all plotted on the one chart (Ward pp. 293). The lines were given different linetypes and shapes as this helps distinguish them via preattentive processing (Ward, pp. 100). Here, the frequency of the linetype is related to the rate of online purchasing.
The line colour was kept consistent, but coloured in keeping with a theme.  Horizontal gridlines help perceive the values of the different points, but we coloured lightly so as not to interfere (Kirk, p22)

The visual shows both the general increasing trend of online purchasing. However, the comparison between the different purchasing frequencies shows that less than five times is much more common. While online purchasing is increasing, there is a possible split between people who use it sparingly and people who use it a lot. There is seemingly a more reliable increase in purchasing between 3-5 times, than the others which tend to plateau. It would seem from this comparison, that this purchasing frequency might become the most common type if trends continue.

*** Online purchasing across the EU28

This visual intends to demonstrate how online purchasing rates differ between states and broader EU regions. Using data for any purchases in the past year, gives us an idea of the availability of online purchasing to individuals, regardless of whether the make it a part of their lives.

It is important to show, on a high level, how the different EU countries compare in terms of making purchases online in the past year. Arguably, this could be an indirect economic indicator. Comparisons of both states and broader regions are possible here. However, downside of this is that finer detail is hidden (Ward p240).

Since the number of dimensions of geographical data are high, a chloropleth was chosen to visualise this.
Most people already can easily home in on a country of interest.
The colour scale has been binned to allow for easier comparison of similar and contrasting regions, though care has been taken to scale this evenly and not mislead the viewer (Monmonier, 43).
The EU countries were directly labelled with their abbreviated forms as there was enough space for these (Kirk, p180).

The visualisation shows that some countries have much different online purchasing rates than others.
This appears to be higher in western and central and Northern EU states, and a line could almost be drawn to seperate these from Southern and Eastern Europe.

A breakdown based on individual countries would be more informative. However, the discrete nature of the spending brackets doesn't not would not easily allow for accurate ranking of states.

**** Information to communicate
Here, we want to show what consumers are buying within the EU, and how the different states compare in terms of their online purchasing habits. Something which is easy to make comparisons, as well as provide detailed data if desired.
**** Motivation and justification
A heatmap type of plot was judged to be the best way to represent this type of data.
Visualisations such as bar charts would be too busy and it would be very difficult to distinguish between variables given the large numbers present.
A simple table would have been too difficult to visually navigate.
**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
The variables along the x and y axis were sorted by the total sum of all their values to order the matrix. This provides a visualisation where comparisons between states or purchase types easy to make, and leads the eye across the visual.
The tiles used both colour and size to differentiate...
One downside to this method of ranking is that it is not immediately obvious where a purchase type or country is along the axis, forcing the viewer to search for them if needed.

**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
It shows that consumer general tend to be proactive using these techniques.
Comparing sites manually on average is the most popular method.
There are some obvious exceptions to the rule.

**** Information to communicate
Here, we want to communicate the demographic differences for buying online. Arguably, the two most basic demographics used to explore populations are age and gender.
**** Motivation and justification
This can help with understanding how diverse online spenders are.
It might be assumed that younger people spend significantly more money than older generations.
Help with understanding how democratised technology has become. Technological pursuits were once the dominated by the younger male demographic. Using 2019 data, we shall see how this has changed.
**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
Distributions can provide insights that summary statistics cant. They can suggest if the different EU states are homogeneous or diverse with respect to certain variables
It might have been necessary to highlight outliers in this data.
Colour is used here, not primarily to distinguish groups, but help lead the eye up the chart with the increasing age groups.
**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
The graph shows that younger generations tend to be more likely to have made purchases.
16-24 year old's maybe don't spend as much as 25 - 34 year olds because they dont have as much money.
75+ age group is heavily concentrated towards the start of the chart. However, there is a split distribution here.
Surprisingly, Romania and Portugal emerge as outliers.

*** Problems buying online and seller location

Also, label outliers on national and EU graphs.

**** Information to communicate
We wanted to show if there was a relationships between encountering problems when ordering online, and the location of the seller.

**** Motivation and justification
One of the issues to buying goods and services online can be the location of the seller. There are the obvious advantages of potentially lower prices and better availability, but problems vary in type from fraud to simply not shipping to certain countries. An high-level picture of this would be useful to determine of buying from far-flung foreign sellers is riskier than more local ones.
**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
We wanted to illustrate the rate of problems occurring when buying online. Illustrating the correlations with simple, un-annotated regression lines in a plain manner was the simplest means of doing this, without the use of statistical coefficients.
Different panels were used for each seller location to make the visual less clutter and legible.
The variations in colour and shape are not essential here, but do help distinguish the panels and leads the viewer through the panels.
It should be noted that this is an indirect correlation, using states as data points. Alot of noise should be expected here.
**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
The plot(s) show a clear trend, where the further afield one looks, the more likely one is to encounter problems. There are exceptions to this however...
It also indirectly shows that buying closer to home is more popular, with ordering further afield being less popular.
