* Background

This project is an exploration of online purchasing within the European Union (EU28). This has risen dramatically over the past couple of decades and has already had an important number of consequences for society such as logistics, the environment, (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/E-commerce_statistics_for_individuals

The questions we wish to answer are how are individuals in different EU states adopting e-commerce, what are some key demographics and behaviours that affect this, and are individuals experiencing problems with engaging in e-commerce. In doing so, we wish to build a picture for the viewer of what makes a typical online purchaser.

** Datasets
Three dataset were extracted from the Eurostat database using the R Eurostat package  (http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/). This package provides a means to easily query the Eurostat database.

Compiled, the datasets had a total of 4615144 rows and 7 columns (fig 1). Most of this data was ultimately not used, being combinations of locations, years and demographics that were not needed (fig 2). Though imputation was considered to deal with missing values, this was ultimately not necessary to generate the visualisations for this project.
These datasets were appended by a dictionary, also downloaded with the Eurostat package to replace the database codes with human-readable labels. Map coordinate data was imported automatically using the R maps package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/.

** Common design choices
There were some design choices that were shared among the visualisations. The fonts used for this project was the Helvetica and Helvetica Neue families. Since the subject matter was technological in nature, a more slightly more futuristic styling was desired, the use of sans-serif fonts was used exclusively. To make the tone was more informative rather the fun, display fonts were also omitted.
The base colour chosen was "#1E448A", the blue used in the EU commissions flag. Gradient colour scales were extended from this, generated using an online tool https://hihayk.github.io/scale/. For some comparisons, tetradic complementary colours were used, which were judged as colour blind safe using an online tool. https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/
Categorical colour schemes were selected to be colour-blind safe and

** Data visualisation
Intro section
*** The rise in purchasing over time
This first question we wish to ask is how common is online purchasing, with the intention of qualifying how the importance of the subject matter. Here, we wish to communicate how the rates of purchasing online have changed over time. With the data available, we can show this for different purchasing rates.
Showing the composition of online purchasing over time and the different purchasing frequencies out there, will inform how significant this subject matter is. It can give an idea of how important purchasing online is becoming.

A number of design choices were made. The number of dimensions was low, so they were all plotted on the one chart (Ward pp. 293). The lines were given different linetypes and shapes as this helps distinguish them via preattentive processing (Ward, pp. 100). Here, the frequency of the linetype is related to the rate of online purchasing.
The line colour was kept consistent, but coloured in keeping with a theme.  Horizontal gridlines help perceive the values of the different points, but we coloured lightly so as not to interfere (Kirk, p22)

The visual shows both the general increasing trend of online purchasing. However, the comparison between the different purchasing frequencies shows that less than five times is much more common. While online purchasing is increasing, there is a possible split between people who use it sparingly and people who use it a lot. There is seemingly a more reliable increase in purchasing between 3-5 times, than the others which tend to plateau. It would seem from this comparison, that this purchasing frequency might become the most common type if trends continue.

*** Online purchasing across the EU28

The second question we will ask is what is the nationality of the online purchaser. This visual intends to demonstrate how online purchasing rates differ between states and broader EU regions. Using data for any purchases in the past year, gives us an idea of the availability of online purchasing to individuals, regardless of whether the make it a part of their lives.

It is important to show, on a high level, how the different EU countries compare in terms of making purchases online in the past year. Arguably, this could be an indirect economic indicator http://repository.londonmet.ac.uk/88/. Comparisons of both states and broader regions are possible here. However, downside of this is that finer detail is hidden (Ward p240).

Since the number of dimensions of geographical data are high, a chloropleth was chosen to visualise this.
Most people already can easily home in on a country of interest.
The colour scale has been binned to allow for easier comparison of similar and contrasting regions, though care has been taken to scale this evenly and not mislead the viewer (Monmonier, 43).
The EU countries were directly labelled with their abbreviated forms as there was enough space for these (Kirk, p180).

The visualisation shows that some countries have much different online purchasing rates than others.
This appears to be higher in western and central and Northern EU states, and a line could almost be drawn to seperate these from Southern and Eastern Europe.

*** Spending brackets within the EU28

(Caption average salary, relating a bar with colour? This is called editorial salience (see slides), drawing viewers attention to meaningful features).

**** Information to communicate
This visual intends to comparing the rates of spending by individuals who are verifiable online shoppers.
**** Motivation and justification
A key aspect of who is doing the purchasing is how much they are spending. his aspect of online purchasing is important to discuss, as it will help inform how reliant and engaged consumers are on online purchasing.
**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
A breakdown based on individual countries would be more informative. However, the discrete nature of the spending brackets doesn't not would not easily allow for accurate ranking of states.
Editorial salience was used here to annotate how two income quartiles relate to these categories. This forms an association with individual wealth.
**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
The visual shows that the 100 - 499 spending bracket is the most common. The annotations indicate a disproportionate amount of the highest and lowest brackets are occupied by the highest and lowest income quartiles. This is not surprising, but informs that this data falls largely in line with peoples wealth.
2% of the data is unaccounted for, as an artifact of the source data.

*** Types of goods and services being purchased

SCALING IS FUCKED!


**** Information to communicate
The visual aims to show what are the most popular categories of online purchases and, out of individuals who are active online shoppers, which countries are these sorts of purchases the most popular.
**** Motivation and justification
It helps answer questions about "What is being bought and by whom?" and is relevent to this exploration of online buying. There are a very diverse number of things that one could spend money on (from clothes and movies to e-learning), and despite their overall ranking, purchasers in individual countries could lead in different categories of goods.
**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
A bubble chart, with areas scaled by their percentage was used (kirk 148). Its use of area takes advantage of pre-attentive processing. Not there may be a slight error in the area scaling.
Visualisations such as bar charts would be too busy and it would be very difficult to distinguish between variables given the large numbers present.
Flags were used
Because there is not much variation between the items, rankings and percentage annotations were employed.
A simple table would have been too difficult to visually navigate, bb so flags were used. The downside here though is it relies on flag knowledge.
The variables along the x and y axis were sorted by the total sum of all their values to order the matrix. This provides a visualisation where comparisons between states or purchase types easy to make, and leads the eye across the visual.
**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
The matrix shows the

*** Consumer buying strategies

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[file:./plot5_pre.png]]

**** Information to communicate
Here, we wish to explore how online purchasers behave and how they go about making purchases. This helps build up our picture of who they are by looking at their behaviour, and not be restricted to physical characteristics.
**** Motivation and justification
Relevant to see how consumers behave at a deeper level. With the increasing amount of commerce being done online is critical for businesses to understand this.
**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
There are 3 components to this chart. The mean lines allow for a casual comparison between the three buying strategies.  The violin component allows us to see how reliable our inferences are, with respect to individual states. The individual points allow us to identify any outliers.
A bar chart with the average would have been sufficient. However, displaying distributions of the individual countries allows for highlighting of outliers.
Since the main goal here was to compare groups and shape, gridlines were omitted (Kirk, 155). The ordering was important for frequency of strategy used, but not the type of strategy.
**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
It shows that most consumers generally tend to be proactive using these techniques, using these techniques at least sometimes. Looking at the means, comparing sites manually is the most popular method on average, suggesting that frugality is a driving factor here. However, while people who always use these methods are the most abundant, they are also the most spread out among states, meaning we cant easily apply that rule universally.
There are also some obvious exceptions to the rule. Ireland tends to be a stark outlier here, with around 60% of shoppers not using these methods. The south eastern states seem to occupy the top spots here, suggesting the are much more careful shoppers.


*** The demographics of online purchasing

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[file:./plot6.png]]

**** Information to communicate
Here, we want to communicate the demographic differences for buying online. Arguably, the two most basic demographics used to explore populations are age and gender.
**** Motivation and justification
This can help with understanding how diverse online spenders are. It might be assumed that younger people buy significantly more money than older generations, though their online engagement with e-commerce is complex https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1940761.1940779.
Help with understanding how democratised technology has become as it has previously been shown that qualities such as age and gender do have and affect https://marketing.business.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/724/2014/08/effect-of-consumer-beliefs-on-online.pdf

**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
Distributions can provide insights that summary statistics cant. They can suggest if the different EU states are homogeneous or diverse with respect to certain variables.
It might have been necessary to highlight outliers in this data.
Colour is used here, not primarily to distinguish groups, but help lead the eye up the chart with the increasing age groups.
**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
The graph shows that younger generations tend to be more likely to have made purchases.
16-24 year old's maybe don't spend as much as 25 - 34 year olds because they dont have as much money.
75+ age group is heavily concentrated towards the start of the chart. However, there is a split distribution here. There were clusters of countries lagging behind for many distributions, but these were not worth annotating.

*** Problems buying online and seller location

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[file:./plot7.png]]
Also, label outliers on national and EU graphs.

**** Information to communicate
We wanted to show if there was a relationships between encountering problems when ordering online, and the location of the seller.

**** Motivation and justification
Consumer trust and loyalty in e-commerce is an area that has got some attention in the literature.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305048305000356 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022435901000653
One of the issues to buying goods and services online can be the location of the seller. There are the obvious advantages of potentially lower prices and better availability, but problems vary in type from fraud to simply not shipping to certain countries. An high-level picture of this would be useful to determine of buying from far-flung foreign sellers is riskier than more local ones.
**** Justification of techniques, layout, style and colour
We wanted to illustrate the rate of problems occurring when buying online. Illustrating the correlations with simple, un-annotated regression lines in a plain manner was the simplest means of doing this, without the use of statistical coefficients.
Different panels were used for each seller location to make the visual less clutter and legible.
The variations in colour and shape are not essential here, but do help distinguish the panels and leads the viewer through the panels.
It should be noted that this is an indirect correlation, using states as data points. Alot of noise should be expected here.
**** What does the visualisation show (e.g. relationship between variables, comparison, distribution, composition)
The plot(s) show a clear trend, where the further afield one looks, the more likely one is to encounter problems. There are exceptions to this however...
It also indirectly shows that buying closer to home is more popular, with ordering further afield being less popular.
